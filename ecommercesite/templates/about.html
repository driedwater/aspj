						<h3>Company History</h3>
						<p>Crafty Wood was established in 1987 with the first physical store located in Singapore, Ang Mo Kio. Crafty Wood has more than 30 years of experience in manufacturing and exporting in hotel furniture, banquet furniture, villa furniture, and most importantly, apartment and outdoor furniture. Our legacy of craftsmanship and style spans more than 30 years and our products are made with pride since day one.</p> 
						<p>Today, Crafty Wood remains committed to the early principles of the company -- great quality, stylish furniture does not need to be expensive and should be available to everyone. A visit to our store physically or digitally and you’ll see just how committed we are to that idea.</p>

						<h3>Mission &amp; Vision</h3>
						<p>At Crafty Wood, our designs are inspired by how you can better experience your family at home. Our designs center not just around the “me” of self-expression, but also the “we” of a home. We hope our designs will facilitate conversations, inspire celebrations or simply help people to create a safe space where they can be themselves.</p> 
						<p>Our designs are also inspired by the greater home we call Earth. Each of our designs ensure that we are able to maximise the usage of every single wooden log, so that no resources are being wasted.</p>
